# This is a script to automate the setup of Google Cloud service account and credentials, required for integrating your Google Play app with RevenueCat.

# Visit https://console.cloud.google.com/, choose the project you want to use, and then click on the Cloud Shell icon in the top right corner.

# In the Cloud Console shell instance, create a new file called `credentials.sh` and paste the code below into it.

#==[IMPORTANT]== Modify the variables below to match your Google Cloud project and service account.

# After modifying the variables below, run the script by typing `bash credentials.sh` in the Cloud Console shell instance terminal. The console will output the status of the script as it runs.

# Once the script has finished running, you will need to upload the `revenuecat-key.json` file to RevenueCat in your Project Settings > Google Play App Settings > Service Account Key.
