  X (TWITTER) – Single tweets (280-char limit per tweet)

Option A (~240 chars):
Built "Pattern Insights" in FitNudge: check in → app learns when you skip, which days are rough, one clear takeaway. "Just track it" wasn't enough—you need to *see* the pattern. [LINK]

Option B (~200 chars):
Pattern Insights: your habit app learns *when* you slip—not "3/7 this week" but "Wednesdays are your skip day, last 7 are up from before." One sentence, from your data. [LINK]

Option C (~180 chars):
Check in daily, but never see when you actually skip? Built Pattern Insights so the app shows you—which days, trending up or down, one takeaway. [LINK]

Option D (~150 chars):
"Pattern Insights" in FitNudge: one sentence from your check-ins—when you slip, which days, whether you're improving. [LINK]

Tweet 1:
Built "Pattern Insights" in my app FitNudge: check in → app learns when you skip, which days are rough, and whether you're improving. One clear sentence, not a dashboard.

Tweet 2:
"Just track it" isn't enough—you need to *see* the pattern before you can change it. Screen record: [LINK]

I’ve been working on FitNudge—an app that nudges you daily on your habits and holds you accountable. One of the features I care about most is something I call Pattern Insights, and I finally got it to a place where it feels honest and useful. Here’s what it does and why I built it.

**The gap I was trying to fill**

Lots of apps show you “you did 4/7 this week.” Fine. But that doesn’t help you *change*. I wanted to answer: When do you actually skip? Is it always the same day? Are you getting better or slowly drifting? And then turn that into one clear, honest sentence—not a dashboard you have to decode.

**What Pattern Insights does**

After you have enough check-ins, the app analyzes your behaviour (e.g. completion rate over the last 7 and 30 days, which weekdays you tend to miss, when you usually complete). It runs deterministic logic first—all the numbers and “risky days” come from code, not from the model guessing. Then a small AI layer turns that into a single, grounded takeaway: e.g. “You often miss mid-week—consider moving that session to the weekend” or “Your last 7 days are stronger than the 7 before; keep that momentum.”

I recorded a short screen flow: you do a check-in, the insight status goes to “generating,” and a few seconds later you see the completion trend and that one sentence. That’s the moment I was aiming for.

**Why I built it this way**

I didn’t want the AI to invent numbers or sound smart at the cost of being wrong. So the design is “compute first, narrate second”: the system decides what’s true from your data, and the AI only phrases it. That took a fair amount of iteration—getting risky days, streaks, and comparisons right in code, and keeping the model on a short leash.

**What I’m learning**

Pattern Insights isn’t perfect yet, but it will give people a clearer picture of when they slip and when they’re improving. If you’re working on habit or accountability products, I’d love to hear how you’re tackling “explain the pattern, don’t just show the number.”

If you want to see it in action, I’ve linked a quick screen record in the first comment. Happy to share more about the stack (React Native, Supabase, Celery, and a small AI layer) if that’s useful.

  LINKEDIN – Shorter variant (still human)
----------------------------------------

Shipped “Pattern Insights” in FitNudge this week.

It answers a simple question: *When* do you actually skip your habit? Which days? Are you improving or drifting?

Instead of another “you did 4/7” summary, it looks at your last 7 and 30 days, figures out your weak days and your trend, and turns that into one clear sentence—e.g. “You often miss Wednesdays” or “Your last 7 days are stronger than the 7 before.”

I built it compute-first: all the numbers and “risky days” come from code; the AI only writes the “so what.” That kept it honest and stopped the AI from hallucinating stats.

I recorded a quick flow: check-in → insights generating → one takeaway. Link in comments if you want to see it.

Would love to hear how others are turning raw habit data into something people actually act on.

  FIRST-COMMENT IDEAS (for LinkedIn)
----------------------------------------

- "Screen recording of the flow: [LINK]. Would love feedback from others building in this space."
- "Tech side: React Native, Supabase realtime, Celery for scheduling, and a small AI layer for the copy. Numbers are computed in Python; the model only phrases the insight."


================================================================================
  Notes for you
  - Swap in your real screen record link where you see [LINK].
  - Adjust “FitNudge,” “Pattern Insights,” and any metrics (e.g. 7/30 days) if your product naming or logic differ.
  - Use or drop the tech/stack line depending on audience.
