# Understanding Your Analytics

The Analytics screen gives you a detailed look at your progress and patterns for each goal. This guide explains each section to help you get the most out of your insights.

---

## Getting Started

### Selecting a Goal

At the top of the screen, you'll see a **goal selector** dropdown. Tap it to switch between your active goals. Each goal has its own separate analytics, so you can track how you're doing on each one individually.

### Choosing a Time Range

Next to the goal selector, you can choose how far back to look:

- **30D** - Last 30 days
- **90D** - Last 90 days
- **180D** - Last 180 days (6 months)

The longer the time range, the more patterns you can discover in your data.

## Analytics Sections

### 1. This Week

**What it shows:** A quick glance at your check-in status for each day of the current week (Sunday through Saturday).

**How to read it:**

- **Green checkmark** - You completed your check-in
- **Green circle (empty)** - Pending for today (you can still check in)
- **Blue moon** - Rest day
- **Gray dash** - Off day (not scheduled)
- **Red X** - Missed check-in
- **Gray circle** - Future day (not yet arrived)

This helps you see at a glance how your current week is going.

---

### 2. Activity Heat Map

**What it shows:** A calendar-style grid showing your activity over the selected time period.

**How to read it:**

- **Green squares** - Days you checked in (darker = completed, lighter = pending)
- **Blue squares** - Rest days
- **Red squares** - Missed check-ins
- **Gray squares** - Off days (not scheduled for this goal)
- **Empty/faded squares** - Future days or days before you created the goal

**Pro tip:** Look for patterns in the grid. Do you see red clusters on certain days? That might indicate when you typically struggle.

### 3. Overview

**What it shows:** Four key statistics summarizing your overall performance:

| Stat                | What it means                                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Completion Rate** | Percentage of scheduled days you completed or took as rest days |
| **Current Streak**  | How many consecutive days you've been successful                |
| **Longest Streak**  | Your all-time best streak for this goal                         |
| **Completed**       | Total number of check-ins you've completed                      |

**How completion rate is calculated:**

- ✅ Completed check-ins count toward your rate
- ✅ Rest days count as successful (they don't hurt your rate)
- ❌ Missed and skipped days count against you
- ⏳ Pending check-ins are not included until resolved

---

### 4. Weekly Consistency

**What it shows:** A bar chart displaying which days of the week you perform best.

**How to read it:**

- Each bar represents a day of the week (Sun-Sat)
- The height shows your success rate (percentage) for that day
- Taller bars = better performance on that day

**Why it's useful:** Discover your strong and weak days. If Fridays are always low, you might want to schedule rest days then or set extra reminders.

---

### 5. Streak History

**What it shows:** A line chart tracking your maximum streak over time, displayed week by week from when you created your goal.

**How to read it:**

- The X-axis shows weeks (W1, W2, W3...)
- The Y-axis shows your streak count
- An upward trend means you're building longer streaks over time

**Why it's useful:** See your long-term progress. Even if you break a streak, this shows whether your overall consistency is improving.

---

### 6. Mood Trend

**What it shows:** How you've been feeling about this goal based on the mood you select when checking in.

**How to read it:**

- The chart tracks your mood score over time
- Three mood levels are shown on the left:
  - 😄 **Amazing** (top)
  - 🙂 **Good** (middle)
  - 😔 **Tough** (bottom)
- An upward trend means you're feeling more positive about the goal

**Why it's useful:** Understanding your emotional relationship with a goal can help you adjust. If mood is trending down, consider if the goal needs to be modified.

**Note:** You need at least 2 check-ins with mood data to see the trend line.

---

### 7. Monthly Trend

**What it shows:** Your completion rate for each month, helping you see long-term patterns.

**How to read it:**

- Each point represents a month's average completion rate
- The percentage shows how well you did that month
- Look for upward trends (improvement) or downward trends (declining)

**Why it's useful:** Monthly view smooths out day-to-day variation and shows your true trajectory. Great for seeing if you're genuinely improving over months.

---

### 8. Skip Reasons

**What it shows:** A pie chart breaking down why you missed check-ins.

**Common reasons include:**

- Too busy
- Forgot
- Not feeling well
- Traveling
- Other priorities

**Why it's useful:** Identifying your most common skip reason helps you address the root cause. If "forgot" is your biggest slice, maybe you need better reminders. If "too busy" dominates, consider adjusting your schedule.

**Note:** If you haven't skipped any check-ins, you'll see a celebratory "No skipped check-ins! 🎉" message instead.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why is my completion rate lower than expected?**
A: Missed and skipped days count against your rate. Rest days do NOT hurt your rate - they count as successful.

**Q: What's the difference between "missed" and "skipped"?**
A: A **skipped** check-in is when you actively chose not to complete it (and optionally provided a reason). A **missed** check-in is when the day passed without any response.

**Q: Why don't I see mood trend data?**
A: You need at least 2 check-ins where you selected a mood to see the trend chart.

**Q: How often is the data updated?**
A: Analytics data refreshes in real-time when you complete check-ins. Pull down on the screen to manually refresh.

**Q: Why do some days show as "off days"?**
A: If you set specific days for your goal (e.g., weekdays only), the other days appear as "off days" and don't affect your statistics.
