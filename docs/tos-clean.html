    <strong><h3>Binding Arbitration</h3></strong>
  </div>

    Any dispute arising from the relationships between the Parties to these

    accordance with the Arbitration and Internal Rules of the European Court of
    Arbitration being part of the European Centre of Arbitration having its seat

    arbitration is filed, and of which adoption of this clause constitutes
    acceptance. The seat of arbitration shall be Frankfurt am Main, Germany. The
    language of the proceedings shall be English. Applicable rules of
    substantive law shall be the law of Germany.
  </div>
  <div>
    <strong><h3>Restrictions</h3></strong>
  </div>
  <div>
    The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
    between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a)
    no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no
    right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis
    or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or

    of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to,
    or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or
    unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision
    is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to

      >These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the
      Services or in respect to the Services constitute the entire agreement and
      understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any
      right or provision of these Legal Terms shall not operate as a waiver of
      such right or provision. These Legal Terms operate to the fullest extent
      permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations
      to others at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss,
      damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable
      control. If any provision or part of a provision of these Legal Terms is
      determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part
      of the provision is deemed severable from these Legal Terms and does not
      affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There
      is no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship
      created between you and us as a result of these Legal Terms or use of the
      Services. You agree that these Legal Terms will not be construed against
      us by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses
      you may have based on the electronic form of these Legal Terms and the
      lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Legal Terms.</span
