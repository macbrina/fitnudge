      "description": "It's easy to lose focus and motivation when building new habits. We've all been there - starting the year with ambitious goals, only to find ourselves giving up by February. Whether it's working out, reading more, learning a new skill, or any other positive habit, staying consistent is hard. That's where FitNudge came about. We realized that what people really need isn't another tracking app or todo list - they need an accountability partner who understands them, believes in them, and is there 24/7 to keep them on track. So we set out to build an AI-powered coach that never sleeps, never judges, and always knows exactly what to say to keep you motivated on your journey to becoming your best self."
