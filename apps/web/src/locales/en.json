      "description": "It's easy to lose focus and motivation when working out. We've all been there â€“ starting the year with ambitious fitness goals, only to find ourselves skipping workouts by February. The gym feels intimidating, personal trainers are expensive, and generic fitness apps just don't understand our unique struggles and motivations. That's where FitNudge came about. We realized that what people really need isn't another workout plan or calorie counter â€“ they need a coach who understands them, believes in them, and is there 24/7 to keep them moving forward. So we set out to build an AI-powered fitness coach that never sleeps, never judges, and always knows exactly what to say to keep you motivated on your journey to better health."
